# Portfolio
This repository points to my main repositories sorted by category.

## APIs
- [Lab Medical BD](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/DiP-M2-projeto-2) - a CRUD API using Spring. It's meant to complement the _Lab Medical_ frontend project.

## Unit Tests
- [Book API](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/BE-JV-011-TESTES-AUTOMATIZADOS) - a CRUD API using Spring centered around books. The main purpose of the project was to work on unit tests and integration tests using JUnit5.
- [Flight Ticket API](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/DiP-M3-projeto-1) - an API using Spring centered around a flight. The main purpose was to work on unit tests.

## Frontend
- [DevInKnowledge](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/DiP-M1-projeto-1) - a CRUD using Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and the browser's local storage for persistence. Does not use any framework.
- [Lab Medical](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/DiP-M-1-projeto-2) - a CRUD using Angular. There's a [github page](https://lucasgdosr.github.io/DiP-M-1-projeto-2/).
- [Product Stock and Supplier CRUD](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/projeto-integrador-2023-1) - an MVP developed for stock control for a local business using Angular. Made for schoolwork only. There's a [github page](https://lucasgdosr.github.io/projeto-integrador-2023-1/).

## Design Patterns
- [LabMedicine](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/DiP-M2-projeto-1) - a CRUD using pure Java. I implemented the _composite_ design pattern for the menu system.
- [Car tests](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/santander-coders-web-full-stack/tree/testes-automatizados-1/testes_automatizados_carros) - an exercise. I implemented all the rules in the Main.java file using the _state_ design pattern.

## Algorithms (all in Java)
- [Binary Heaps](https://github.com/ppenna/playground/tree/main/data-structures/binary-heap/java) - some implementations of binary heaps in Java, including a "median heap", that always returns the median.
- [BST](https://github.com/ppenna/playground/tree/main/data-structures/binary-search-tree/java) - a BST that can perform all kinds of operations based on _compare_ routines.
- [Quicksort w/ Duplicate Keys](https://github.com/ppenna/playground/tree/main/sorting/quicksort/java) - a quicksort implementation that's better suited for dealing with many duplicate keys in the array.
- Union Find (TBA) - some interesting interview questions answered, and a Monte Carlo simulation of a percolation problem.
- Stacks & Queues (TBA) - a Deque implementation, a Stack implementation, a Queue implementation that uses 2 Stacks under the hood (not for production), and a Randomized Queue.
- IsBST (TBA) - an algorithm to check if a tree is a binary search tree.
- 2D Tree (TBA) - an efficient data structure to find all points inside a given rectangle, or to find the nearest point given another point.

## Misc
- [CS50 Final Project](https://github.com/LucasGdosR/CS50-Final-Project) - my first web application. It's filled with bad practices, but also has some linear programming using python's scipy, as well as frontend/backend integration using flask.
